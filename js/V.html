        <h3>Variables</h3>
            <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
            <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
            <p>You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.</p>

            <h3>Declaring variables</h3>
            <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:  <br>
                With the keyword var. For example,</p>
                <p class="high">var x = 42.</p>
                <p>This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
                    <br>
                    By simply assigning it a value. For example,</p>
                    <p class="high">x = 42.
                    </p>
                    <p>This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.

                    With the keyword let. For example</p>
                    <p class="high">let y = 13.</p>
                    <p>This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below.</p>

                    <h3>Variable scope</h3>
                        <p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement.</p>
                        <p class="high">if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</p>
                        <p>This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.</p>
                        <p class="high">if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not
                            defined</p>
                            <h3>Global variables</h3>
                            <p>Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global variables using the window.variable syntax.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber.</p>
