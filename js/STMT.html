                        <h3>if..... else statement</h3>
                            <p>Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:</p>
                            <p class="high">if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</p>
                            <p>condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise, statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any statement, including further nested if statements.</p>
                                <br>

                        <h3>While statement</h3>
                            <p>A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:</p>
                            <p class="high">while (condition) statement</p>
                            <p>If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the statement following the loop.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If the condition returns true, statement is executed and the condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops and control is passed to the statement following while.</p>

                        <h3>Function declaration</h3>
                        <p>A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The name of the function.</li>
                            <li>The name of the function.</li>
                            <li>The name of the function.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:</p>
                        <p class="high">function square(number) { return number * number; }</p>
                        <p>The function square takes one argument, called number. The function consists of one statement that says to return the argument of the function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return statement specifies the value returned by the function.</p>
